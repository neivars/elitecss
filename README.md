# elite.css

A CSS file for buildings UIs that resemble the ingame Elite Dangerous iconic orange menus, in case you want to bring your web fancontent closer to the homely COVAS feel.

ðŸš€ Huge shoutout to [Elite Dangerous Assets](https://edassets.org/). They host a wealth of high-quality fanmade raster and vector graphics from the game's UI.

## Work in Progress

These styles are a work in progress. A lot still needs to be designed.

Some good CSS-framework level documentation will also emerge, hopefully.

## Installation

### CSS Release

Grab the latest `elite.css` file release and link it in your HTML. The classes are now available to you, namespaced under `ed-*`.

### Build from SASS

If you want to tweak the css output, customize it or just break it, then you'll [need SASS first](https://sass-lang.com/install).

After installing SASS, clone the repo and output the `elite.css` with

```bash
$ sass src/scss/elite.scss dist/css/elite.css
```

`elite.scss` is the entry point of all other SASS partials and pieces.
